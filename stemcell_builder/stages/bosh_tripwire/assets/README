This directory is used to build the public stemcells and you need to know the
"local" passphrase to do so. The passphrase needs to be set in the environment
variable TW_PASSPHRASE.

If you want to build your own stemcell with tripwire support you must replace
site.key & local.key with your own keys, and then generate your own tw.cfg &
tw.pol using those keys.
